  <p>
   Write a script that will use NLTK's Gutenberg plaintext corpus
   <code>
    "carroll-alice.txt"
   </code>
   to find the five most common words that directly follow the word
   <code>
    "Alice"
   </code>
   in Alice in Wonderland.
  </p>
  <p>
   When run as a script, it should print, in decreasing order of frequency, each word and its count on its own line, separated by a space, like this:
  </p>
  <pre><code>laughed 29
sang 24
i 10
slept 2
spoke 2
</code></pre>
  <p>
   If two words have the same frequency, either order is fine. (Note these are not the right answers!)
  </p>
  <p>
   Use the
   <code>
    words()
   </code>
   method of the NLTK corpus. This will get you an iterable over words in the text that crosses sentence boundaries, so if a sentence ends with
   <code>
    Alice
   </code>
   , the first word of the next sentence counts as a word that follows
   <code>
    Alice
   </code>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Like in Homework 1, skip over words that consist entirely of punctuation marks, so in
   <code>
    Alice, the hare, and the hatter
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    the
   </code>
   follows
   <code>
    Alice
   </code>
   , even though there's an intervening comma.
  </p>
  <p>
   Treat words as case-
   <strong>
    in
   </strong>
   sensitive. That is,
   <code>
    The
   </code>
   and
   <code>
    the
   </code>
   count as the same word. Note:
   <code>
    Alice
   </code>
   is always capitalized, so it doesn't matter if you lower-case it or not.
  </p>
  <p>
   If imported as a module, your script shouldn't print anything or read or write any files. It may import modules, or define functions or classes, but not run them.
  </p>
  <p>
   Save it as
   <code>
    alice.py
   </code>
