<h2>Mini-assignment</h2>

<p><strong>Filename</strong> <code>alice.py</code></p>

<p>Write a script that will use NLTK's Gutenberg plaintext corpus <code>"carroll-alice.txt"</code> to find the five most common words that directly follow the word <code>"Alice"</code> in Alice in Wonderland. </p>

<p>When run as a script, it should print, in decreasing order of frequency, each word and its count on its own line, separated by a space, like this:</p>

<pre><code>laughed 29
sang 24
i 10
slept 2
spoke 2
</code></pre>

<p>If two words have the same frequency, either order is fine.</p>

<p>Use the <code>words()</code> method of the NLTK corpus. This will get you an iterable over words in the text that crosses sentence boundaries, so if a sentence ends with <code>Alice</code>, the first word of the next sentence counts as a word that follows <code>Alice</code>. </p>

<p>Treat words as case-<strong>in</strong>sensitive. That is, <code>The</code>, <code>THE</code>, and <code>the</code> count as the same word, and same with <code>ALICE</code>, <code>Alice</code>, etc.</p>

<p>Skip over words that consist entirely of punctuation marks, so in <code>Alice, the hare, and the hatter</code>, <code>the</code> follows <code>Alice</code>, even though there's an intervening comma. I recommend a list comprehension with regular expressions to remove all punctuation from the corpus, e.g.:</p>

<p><code>words = [w.lower() for w in words if re.search(r'\w', w)]</code></p>

<p>If imported as a module, your script shouldn't print anything or read or write any files. It may import modules, or define functions or classes, but not run them.</p>

<p>Save it as <code>alice.py</code>.</p>
